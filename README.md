Fill the name and label section and in the "Script" section we need to write our python script.

# 2. Vex:

The VEX allows you to write a custom surface node that manipulates point attributes. This can move points around, adjust velocities, change colors. As well, you can group points or do many other useful tasks. VEX SOPs typically run 10 or more times faster than a point SOP.

To use vex to manipulate SOP attributes we use "attribute wrangle" node.
